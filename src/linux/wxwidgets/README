BUILDING wxWidgets for TreeMaker 5.0 for Linux
  by Carlos A. Furuti

1. INTRODUCTION

Several aspects of the wxWidgets library may be configured as
compile-time options. Unfortunately, this means applications may
depend on features not available on every binary distribution of
wxWidgets. Therefore, if you want to compile TreeMaker 5.0 from
source, you must also compile a properly configured wxWidgets source
package, _even_ if you already have wxWidgets installed.

2. GETTING wxWidgets

Download the source code of wxWidgets from www.wxwidgets.org. You'll
need the GTK package, wxGTK-<version at least 2.6.1, but no 2.7 or
later>.tar.bz2. Unpack it in a suitable temporary directory (a full
build, explained below, will require about 510 MB in a i386 platform). 
From now on, we'll abbreviate the wxWidgets directory (containing, 
e.g., the "configure" file) as WXD. Take note of this directory path,
we'll need it in TreeMaker 5.0's own Makefile.

Notice - wxWidgets 2.7.0 and above changed the help API, unfortunately
making it incompatible with TreeMaker. Until the TreeMaker developers
can afford time to update it, please don't try using those newer wxWidgets
versions - it simply will not work.

3. PATCHING

wxWidgets (at least up to and including version 2.6.4) for GTK does
not fully or correctly support some features required by TreeMaker 5,
including:

- thin lines with subpoint precision
- user-defined dashes (fixed in 2.6.3 Release Candidate 2)
- correctly scaled circles (GNOME print only; fixed in 2.6.3RC2)
- clipping when printing
- document files with no suffix or suffixes other than the default
  .tmd5 (fixed in 2.6.3RC2)
- double-clicking lists (scheduled to be fixed after 2.6.3RC2)
- crash when releasing a copied widget border

Unless you downloaded a more recent version of wxWidgets fixing these
issues, you're strongly advised to "cd" to WXD and extract the files
which you'll find in this directory:

- wxPatch2.6.2.tar.gz (for wxGTK 2.6.2, 2.6.3RC1 or previous)
- wxPatch2.6.3.tar.gz (for wxGTK 2.6.3RC2 or greater)
- wxPatch2.6.4.tar.gz (for wxGTK 2.6.4) 

4. COMPILING

Copy the build-wxw.sh file from this directory to WXD, then cd to WXD.
If you don't need Unicode support, you may edit build-wxw.sh and remove 
the "--enable-unicode" string.

wxWidgets may be compiled in a "release" or "debug" version, or both.
If you're developing or debugging TreeMaker 5.0, you'll probably need
the debug version. If you're only compiling TreeMaker because the
binary package does not suit you (maybe you don't have the required
DLLs), you might create only the release version of wxWidgets and save
some time and a lot of disk space.

For building a static library (TreeMaker 5.0 uses a static library for
portability reasons) in both versions, type:

  sh build-wxw.sh

If you don't want the debug version, type:

  sh build-wxw.sh --nodebug

If you don't want the release version, type:

  sh build-wxw.sh --norelease

If you slightly edited (without changing or creating new dependencies)
wxWidgets or reapplied the patch, do as above adding "--noconfig",
otherwise everything will be recompiled.

Running build-wxw.sh will neither install wxWidgets nor disturb any
existing installed wxWidgets. You may safely remove WXD after
TreeMaker 5.0 is compiled and tested.

You may now configure and compile TreeMaker.

5. OPTIONAL NOTES

If you have installed a dynamic version of wxWidgets configured
according to TreeMaker 5.0's needs (inspect the build-wxw.sh), you
might try adapting the latter's Makefile to use it.
