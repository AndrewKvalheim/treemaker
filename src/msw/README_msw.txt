BUILDING and INSTALLING TreeMaker 5.0 for MS Windows 9x, Me, NT, 2000, XP, 2003  by Wlodzimierz 'ABX' Skiba1. INTRODUCTIONThis file describes the basic procedures for building from source, installingand running TreeMaker 5.0 for Windows (TM5W for short). It is not needed forinstalling and using a TM5W binary bundle.This and all other files in this directory are subject to the same licenseconditions mentioned in the Source/README.txt file, here referred to as themain README.Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corp.2. BEFORE YOU STARTRequisites for building TM5W:- TreeMaker 5.0 requisites (see main README)- One of MS Windows 9x, Me, NT, 2000, XP, 2003 - MinGW driven from Windows console (not MSYS)- wxWidgets (TM5W was tested with the wxMSW version), as described belowTM5W was mainly developed and tested on Windows 2000 and XP SP2. TM5W shouldwork on other MS Windows flavours thanks to using wxWidgets toolkit.3. TreeMaker CONFIGURATIONSTM5W build was tested in two major configurations, debug and release, but thereis the possibility of mixing build settings into more combinations. with "WX_DEBUG=0 TMBUILD=release" : production versionwith "WX_DEBUG=1 TMBUILD=debug"   : development versionThere are more options and some are related to the wxWidgets build. They areall listed in the beginning of msw/makefile.gcc file together with a shortdescription.4. BUILDING AND INSTALLING TM5W FROM SOURCE4.1. Compiling wxWidgetsTreeMaker 5.0's user interface uses the multiplatform open-sourcelibrary wxWidgets. For maximum portability, TM5W is statically linked.The complete command used to build wxWidgets for release of TM5W was:mingw32-make.exe -f makefile.gcc SHARED=0 RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 MONOLITHIC=0 BUILD=releaseNote that not all features of wxWidgets are used in TM5W. Unused features canbe turned off before a wxWidgets rebuild. This is done by providing a modifiedsetup0.h. After obtaining a fresh wxWidgets copy, this file should be copiedfrom msw/setup0.h to wxWidgets/include/wx/msw/setup0.h path.4.2. Configuring your BuildBuilding TM5W requires the environment variable WXWIN pointing to wxWidgets path.4.3. Building TreeMakerThe complete command used to build wxWidgets for release of TM5W was:mingw32-make.exe -f makefile.gcc WX_SHARED=0 WX_UNICODE=1 WX_DEBUG=0 PROFILE=0 TMBUILD=releaseThis command will create a subdirectory in the msw directory of TM5W and willcreate there 5 command line test tools and the main executable.4.4 Installing TreeMakerYou can run TM5W from any path (including the subdirectory where it wascreated) but you need to put in the same directory the splash screen, ziparchive with help files, and the about page. They are all located under Sourcedirectory of TM5W and need to be copied into the executable path.4.5. Building a Distribution BundleThe Windows installer is made with Inno Setup, which is available athttp://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php . The required script is located inmsw/treemaker.iss. Also, the mingwm10.dll runtime library from MinGW isrequired for running the executable.
