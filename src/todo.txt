/**************************************
WXWIDGETS PROBLEMS
**************************************/

A. Fixed for 2.6.3 and 2.7.X but missing in earlier releases

 1. dashed lines in gnome printing
 2. circles in gnome printing
 3. template filename validation if document/view code

B. Not fixed in wxWidgets yet

 4. activation in document/view code
 5. built-in error messages sent from dialog are behind dialog when
    wxSTAY_ON_TOP is on
 6. GNOME printing does not implement clipping
 7. GNOME printing uses 1"/72 as the unit measure [and I couldn't figure out
    how to get higher resolution]
 8. wxMAC modal dialogs have the wrong title bar style (no 3 buttons, even
    disabled, on left)

/**************************************
FEATURE REQUESTS (not necessarily approved)
**************************************/

A 'select all <part types>" command - it would be useful for path quantisation,
so you don't have to pick the active paths one at a time. [RJL: but you rarely
should select all paths; you would only select paths on one side. Perhaps a
more useful command would be if symmetry is on, "select all paths with at least
one leaf node on left."]

A big feature request:  Creating mirror nodes on trees; ie being able to select
a paticular set of nodes and automatically generating a paired set of nodes
with the same attributes.  Again, it'll be nice for lazy users who want to draw
symmetric trees, so all they'll have to do is to draw half the tree, and then
mirror-image it.

Change quantization dialog so that user enters "N" but program uses 2N
internally. Change docs to explain why we're doing this.

If we could decide which flaps are hingeable (is there a better word for those
flaps which are not embedded inside other flaps?) we could optimize the hinge
angles (maybe maxing the sum of tip distances while forbidding intersections)
and present an OpenGL window with the folded base.

Implement an optimizer based on the donlp2 optimization code of P. Spellucci.

ABX: Monitoring and improving builds with more compilers (ie. bug in STL of VC)

ABX: MetaFile export (by paste) area configurable.

ABX: Single top-level-window-MDI architecture on Windows (low priority).
[RJL: there is some wxW discussion of implementing MDI properly on Mac so that
TM could use the standard wxW MDI implementation and get the proper behavior on
all platforms.]

ABX: Range (rectangle) selection by draging mouse pointer (basic implementation
     done, needs rethinking in terms of UI consistency)
