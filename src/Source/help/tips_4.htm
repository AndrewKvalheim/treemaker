<h2>Tips 4: Fracturing Polygons</h2>

<p>
Once you have completed an optimization, the simplest crease pattern that
collapses into a base is produced by choosing <b>Action->Build Crease
Pattern</b>, which creates all creases using the "universal molecule"
algorithm. You can also break up high-order active polygons into lower-order
active polygons by adding new edges to existing nodes. When you create a new
edge and scale it using <b>Action->Scale Selection</b>, it will be expanded until
it forms new active paths; typically 3 new paths are formed, although if the
polygon is mirror-symmetric, sometimes 4 new paths will be formed.
</p>
<p>
This process will break any polygon of order 5 or higher into polygons of lower
order. In general, the lower the order of the active polygon, the simpler it is
to fold, so this is often a desirable process. However, if you try to break up
a polygon of order 4 (a quadrilateral), unless it happens to have a line of
symmetry, you will form two triangles and another quadrilateral. Thus, you
cannot in general reduce a crease pattern to all triangles simply by adding new
edges to existing nodes.
</p>
<p>
As an example, construct the tree shown in Figure Ti-4-1, which has four edges
of all different lengths.

</p>
<p>
When you optimize this tree, you will get an irregular quadrilateral, as shown
in Figure Ti-4-2. 
</p>

  <b>Figure Ti-4-2.</b>
</p>
<p>
Building creases gives you a "gusset quadrilateral" as shown in Figure Ti-4-3.
</p>

  <b>Figure Ti-4-3.</b>
</p>
<p>
Supposed we want to break up this quadrilateral into triangles. Kill the crease
pattern and add a new edge to node 2; then choose <b>Action->Scale Selection</b> to
maximize the length of the new edge. You should get something like the polygon
pattern shown in Figure Ti-4-4. Indeed, the quad has been broken into two
triangles --- and another quad. 
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_4_4.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-4-4.</b>
</p>
<p>
The process can be repeated essentially infinitely; you can make the quad
smaller and smaller, but you'll never get rid of it! Figure Ti-4-5 continues
the process, but there is still one quadrilateral.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_4_5.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-4-5.</b>
</p>
<p>
There is a fundamental reason for this limitation: breaking up an arbitrary
quad into four triangles requires the formation of four active paths. But when
you add a new edge to an existing node, you only have three degrees of freedom:
the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of the new node and the length of the
edge. To create four active paths, you need a fourth degree of freedom.
</p>
<p>
If, instead of adding the new edge to an existing node, we add the new edge to
a newly-created node formed by splitting an edge, we have a fourth degree of
freedom: the location of the split along the edge. An edge that creates four
active paths with the corners of its enclosing polygon is called a
<em>stub</em>, and <em>TreeMaker</em> has an entire submenu devoted to their
generation: the <b>Edit->Stub</b> submenu. These commands let you break up one
or more polygons by splitting one of the edges of the subtree spanned by the
nodes at the corners of the polygon.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to break up a polygon is when the crease pattern has been
built: click near the border of the (yellow) polygon to which the stub is to be
added. To see this in our example, delete the fifth node and edge we added
and choose <b>Action->Build Crease Pattern</b>. Then click near the boundary of
the big yellow polygon. The polygon will become selected, as shown in Figure Ti-4-6.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_4_6.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-4-6.</b>
</p>
<p>
Fully-constructed polygons can contain smaller polygons; this polygon contains
two smaller triangles, which are not selected. Only "outermost" polygons 
--- called <em>tree polygons</em> --- can be broken up by the addition
of a stub. Now that the polygon is selected, choose <b>Edit->Stub->Pick For
Poly...</b>. This brings up a dialog, shown in Figure Ti-4-7.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_4_7.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-4-7.</b>
</p>
<p>
This dialog lists information about the possible stub(s) that can be added: the
edge that would be split; the lengths of the two parts of the edge; the nodes
to which active paths will be formed; and the length of the new edge. In this
case, there is only one possible stub, but in general, there can be multiple
possibilities. Click OK.
</p>
<p>
The edge is split, and a new node and edge added, which forms 4 active paths
with surrounding nodes. A stub will always form at least 4 active paths, but it
is sometimes possible that one forms 5 or more. This stub has now broken the
quadrilateral up into four triangles, each of which can be filled with the
rabbit ear molecule. 
</p>

  <b>Figure Ti-4-8.</b>
</p>
<p>
The resulting crease pattern looks like that of a distorted Bird Base, as shown
in Figure Ti-4-9.
</p>
<p align="center">

  <b>Figure Ti-4-9.</b>
</p>
<p>
And the folded form looks something like a distorted Bird Base as well.

</p>
<p>
There are several commands accessible from the <b>Edit->Stub</b> submenu:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Edit->Stub->Pick for Nodes...</b> lets you pick the stub that makes four
    active paths with any group of four or more selected nodes. In this way,
    you can construct stubs without having had to construct the crease pattern
    (which is necessary to be able to select a poly).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Edit->Stub->Pick for Poly...</b> lets you pick which stub for a selected poly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Edit->Stub->Add Largest to Nodes</b> automatically chooses the largest
    stub if there are multiple possibilities for a group of 4 or more selected
    nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Edit->Stub->Add Largest to Poly</b> automatically chooses the largest
    stub for the selected poly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Edit->Stub->Triangulate Tree</b> repeatedly adds stubs to a tree until
    every polygon in the tree has been broken into triangles. This gives a
    crease pattern composed entirely of rabbit ear molecules. If you have the
    positions of all the nodes in such a tree, then in a triangulated tree, all
    other creases can be folded with reference to the node positions; the same
    cannot be said for general crease patterns consisting of universal
    molecules.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of this property of triangulated trees, stub creation can be a useful
technique for making a <em>TreeMaker</em> design more easily foldable without
need to measure. A different set of techniques for making patterns more easily
foldable will be described in the next section.
