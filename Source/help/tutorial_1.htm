This section contains tutorial introductions to the capabilities of
<em>TreeMaker</em>. I will walk you through the basic process of setting of a
<em>TreeMaker</em> design and constructing a crease pattern. The tutorials are:

<h2><a name="tutorial_1">Tutorial 1: Designing a Base</a></h2>
<p>
In this tutorial, you will work through the design of a 4-legged animal with a
head and tail and will learn the fundamentals of designing a model with
<em>TreeMaker</em>. Before starting it, you should understand the fundamentals
of origami design, such as the difference between corner, edge, and middle
flaps and be familiar with the basic origami procedures and terms such as
valley fold, mountain fold, reverse fold, rabbit ear, et cetera.
</p>
<p>
TreeMaker designs an origami base that can be represented by a stick figure.
You specify the desired proportions of your base by drawing a stick figure in
the square and specifying its dimensions. If you have ever used a vector
drawing program like Macromedia Freehand, Adobe Illustrator, Deneba Canvas,
Corel Draw, etc., you should have no trouble in figuring out how to draw a
figure, but if you haven't, we'll walk you through it.
</p>
<p>
Begin by double-clicking on the <em>TreeMaker</em> icon to launch it. This will
create a new, untitled window that displays a square --- the default shape of
paper. Later, you will see how to change the size and shape of the paper (you
can even design for a rectangle if you like) but for now we'll use a square.
</p>
<p>
If <em>TreeMaker</em> is already running, you can create a new, untitled
document by selecting the <b>File->New</b> menu command.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_1.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-1.</b> A new, untitled <em>TreeMaker</em> document shows a
  blank square.
</p>
<p>
Initially, the square is blank. We will define the tree by drawing on the
square, but the tree is really an abstract concept. Several points on the tree
correspond to distinct, identifiable points on the square, so as a matter of
convenience we will draw the tree on the square.
</p>
<p>
Even before we've drawn anything, there is one important attribute of the
design: the <em>scale</em>, which is always displayed in the bottom of the
design window. The scale is the ratio between the characteristic size of the
base and the size of the square, so larger is better: a larger scale gives a
larger base in the end. The scale always starts out with a value of 0.1, but
over the course of the design, we will find a better value for this quantity.
</p>
<p>
Click once in the middle of the square. You will see a dot appear with a number
above it and a circle around it as in Figure Tu-1-2. This dot is a
<em>node</em>; the number is the index of the node, which is used to identify
the node later on. Each node is assigned a unique index. You can ignore the
index for now. If you clicked just once, the node is a big dot, which means
that it is <em>selected</em>. If the node is a small dot, it is
<em>deselected</em>. A node represents either the tip of a flap or a point
where multiple flaps come together. The circle represents the amount of paper
required to form the flap whose tip is represented by a node.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_2.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-2.</b> A single node in the new tree.
</p>
<p>
If exactly one node is selected and you click somewhere else, a new node will
be placed at the click location with a line connecting the nodes. The line
between the two nodes is called an <em>edge</em>. We'll do this now. Make sure
the node is selected (click once on it so that it is highlighted) and then
click once above the node; you have now created an edge connecting the two
nodes. Note that the new node is now selected (highlighted), as is the edge, as
shown in Figure Tu-1-3.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_3.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-3.</b> Two nodes and an edge in the tree.
</p>
<p>
The edge displays two numbers near its midpoint: the index, which serves to
identify the edge, and another number below it, which is the desired length of
the edge. The length of the edge is proportional to the length of the
corresponding flap on the base. The proportionality constant is the
aforementioned scale.
</p>
<ul><li>
Note: all lengths on the tree are defined relative to each other, not relative
to the size of the square. All flaps use the same scale, so for any flap, the
product of its tree length and the scale gives the length of its corresponding
flap relative to the size of the paper.
</li></ul>
<p>
All edges start out with a length of 1.000 by default; later you'll learn how
to change the length of an edge. Note too that the displayed length of the edge
doesn't change when you drag nodes and edges around. This is an important
point: <em>the displayed length is not the actual length of the drawn line;
it's the desired length of the corresponding flap</em>.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of nodes in a tree. <em>Leaf nodes</em> are nodes that have
only one edge incident upon them. <em>Branch nodes</em> have two or more edges
incident upon them. Leaf nodes correspond to the tips of flaps; branch nodes
correspond to points where multiple flaps come together. Leaf nodes (and only
leaf nodes) are drawn with circles around them; the radius of the circle is the
scaled length (edge length times tree scale) of the incident edge. The size of
the circle indicates the minimum area of the paper needed fr the flap that
corresponds to the incident edge; longer edges mean larger circles. Larger
circles consume more paper, leaving less paper for other parts of the tree. The
process of designing a uniaxial origami base amounts to laying out the nodes in
a way that insures that every flap gets the right amount of  paper; the node
circles provide some visual feedback of how much paper is needed by the leaf
nodes --- or rather, by the edges that are incident to the leaf nodes.
</p>
<ul><li>
Note: branch nodes don't have circles around them, but flaps that correspond to
edges that are only incident to branch nodes also require paper; however, the
shapes they require, called <em>rivers</em>, are more complex than circles and
so are not drawn in <em>TreeMaker</em>.
<<p>
As mentioned earlier, if you click on an existing node, it becomes selected. If
you hold down the mouse button after clicking you can drag the node around on
the square. If exactly one node is already selected and you click elsewhere in
the square, you create a new node at the click location and create a new edge
connected to the selected node. (If zero or two or more nodes are selected and
you click elsewhere, everything gets deselected.) You can also click on edges
and drag them; dragging an edge drags the nodes at each end. You can select
more than one node or edge at a time by holding down the Shift key when you
click on nodes or edges. The collection of selected nodes and edges is called
the <em>selection</em>.
</p>
<p>
The following are all the things you do with clicks:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Click on a node or edge to select it and deselect everything else.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shift-click on a deselected node or edge to add it to the selection
  </li>
  <li>
    Shift-click on a selected node or edge to remove it from the selection
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
By clicking and dragging, you can change the position of a node or edge. As you
build up constraints on the position of a node, a node can become "pinned" and
you won't be able to drag it around any more. However, if you hold down the
appropriate modifier key (Option on Mac, Alt on Windows, Alt or Control on Linux)
while clicking, you can override this behavior and drag a pinned node. 
</p>
<p>
To delete a node or edge, you can either hit the <em>Backspace</em> or
<em>Delete</em> key or select <b>Edit->Clear</b>. Although you can't drag a
pinned node without holding down a modifier key, you can delete any node at any
time.
</p>
<p>
Keyboard commands for editing are:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Delete</em> or <em>forward Delete</em> to delete selected nodes or
      edges
    </li>
    <li>
      Command-A (Control-A in non-Macintosh platforms) to select everything
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Tab</em> or Shift-Command-A to deselect everything
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
Deleting a leaf node also removes the attached edge. Similarly, deleting an
edge also deletes any nodes that would otherwise be orphaned.
</p>
<ul><li>
Note: you can't delete a node or edge if it would break the tree into two
pieces. You'll get an error message if you try.
</li></ul>
<p>
Now we will build a tree. Choose <b>Edit->Select->All</b> and then choose
<b>Edit->Clear</b> (or hit <em>Delete</em>) to get rid of what's currently on
the square. Now, starting near the bottom of the square, click once to place a
node; then click once about 1/3 of the way up; click once again about 2/3 of
the way up; and click once near the top of the square. You will have created a
line of four nodes and three edges as shown in Figure Tu-1-4.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_4.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-4.</b>
</p>
<p>
This line of nodes represents the head (top), body (middle) and tail (bottom)
of the animal. Note that only the two leaf nodes have node circles drawn around
them.
</p>
<p>
Now we will add side branches to the tree. Click once on node 2 to select it,
then click once to the left of node 2; this adds a leg. Click again on node 2
to select it and click once to the right of node 2; this adds another leg, as
shown in Figure Tu-1-5.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_5.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-5.</b>
</p>
<p>
Got the hang of it? Now try to add two more legs to node 3, so that you wind up
with something that looks like Figure Tu-1-6.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_6.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-6.</b>
</p>
<p>
This stick figure represents an animal with a head, two front legs, a body, two
rear legs, and a tail. It will be used to define a base with flaps for the
head, legs, body, and tail. Since all of the edges of the stick figure have the
same relative length, each of the flaps of the base (and the body) will be the
same length in this example.
</p>
<p>
Note that the nodes are outlined by amber lines. These lines are called
<em>border paths</em>; they'll define the usable region of the square when
we're done.
</p>
<p>
At this stage of the game, you can click on nodes and edges and move them about
rather easily because none of them are pinned. Click on nodes 7 and 8 and drag
them upward so that they lie above node 4, as shown in Figure Tu-1-7.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_7.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-7.</b>
</p>
<p>
When you have defined the stick figure, it's time to start computing the crease
pattern. Go to the Action menu and select the command <b>Action->Scale
Everything</b>. This starts the computation of the crease pattern. You can tell
that the calculation is running from two things: first, a small window will pop
up as the calculation proceeds; second, the positions of the nodes will change
and move around. Depending on the power of your machine, the calculation can
take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.
</p>
<ul><li>
Note: if you get tired of waiting during a calculation, you can always
interrupt it by pressing Control-C or Command-Period, or by clicking on the
Cancel button.
</li></ul>
<p>
Let this calculation run until the progress window disappears and things stop
moving around. You should see a pattern something like Figure Tu-1-8. (Your
example might look like the figure turned upside-down; if it does, don't worry
about it.)
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_8.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-8.</b>
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of information in this figure, so let me spend a few minutes
describing what we're seeing. Several green lines have appeared that connect
leaf nodes and they have dots and numbers along them. The stick figure has been
distorted because the leaf nodes have moved. The node circles have expanded
until some of them touch each other. And last, the scale displayed at the
bottom of the window has changed from 0.10000 to 0.2669.
</p>
<p>
Here's what this all means. The green lines between them indicate fold lines in
the base. (They will be mountain folds most of the time). They are called
active paths (for reasons that will come later). 
</p>
<p>
The tree as drawn has been distorted because the leaf nodes have been moved.
Note, however, that the numbers along each edge that specify the desired flap
length have not changed. Each leaf node corresponds to a unique identifiable
vertex in the crease pattern (which is the vertex at the tip of the
corresponding flap); we draw the leaf nodes at the positions of their
corresponding vertices. That is, when you fold the base, the tip of the head
flap will come from the point on the paper where the leaf node that corresponds
to the head is located.
</p>
<p>
The scale, too, has changed; it is now larger, with a value of 0.2669. That
means that a flap that is 1.0 units long on the tree will actually be 0.2669
units long on the paper. The scale thus specifies the overall size of the base.
Since the scale has gotten larger, the circle sizes (which, recall, are the
product of the tree scale and the length of the edge incident to the node at
the circle center) are also correspondingly larger. The circles have expanded
until they touch, but they don't overlap. Recall that each circle encloses the
minimum paper needed for its corresponding flap. If two circles overlapped, the
paper in the overlap would belong to two different flaps.
</p>
<p>
What <b>Action->Scale Everything</b> actually does is to move around the leaf
nodes to try to find an arrangement that gives the largest possible base,
subject to the proviso that all of the edges maintain the same lengths relative
to each other and all of the paper in the tree ends up in at most one flap. In
Figure Tu-1-8, there is a large region of paper that doesn't seem to belong to
any circle, but it still belongs to a flap: in this case, the flap
corresponding to edge 2. Since edge 2 isn't incident to any leaf nodes, it
doesn't have a circle --- but it still requires a certain amount of paper.
</p>
<p>
Although all of the edges are enlarged by the same amount, at the optimum
configuration, at least some of the edges cannot be enlarged any more by any
node movement whatsoever. Such edges are called "pinned" edges. In this
optimization, all of the edges are pinned. In general, for small trees, after
you have run the Scale Everything command, all or nearly all of the edges will
be in this state. Pinned edges are shown in a lighter shade of blue than
unpinned edges.
</p>
<p>
Most of these dots, lines, circles, and numbers are here for illustrative
purposes and you will learn later how to turn on and off their display. The
green lines, however, correspond to actual creases in the base; the folds are
(usually) mountain folds. The folds along these lines will run along the
<em>axis</em> of the folded base, and they are called <em>axial</em> folds.
</p>
<p>
The green lines are not themselves creases; rather, they are visual
representations of relationships between nodes, called <em>paths</em>. For any
two leaf nodes on the tree, there is a path, which relates two distances: the
distance between the two nodes on the paper (or rather, between the vertices
that correspond to the two nodes); and the distance between the two nodes as
measured along the tree and scaled to the paper. If the distance between the
nodes on the paper is greater than or equal to the scaled distance between the
two nodes on the tree, the path is said to be <em>feasible</em>. If not, it is
<em>infeasible</em>. if the two distances are exactly equal, the path is said
to be <em>active</em>. Paths are color-coded in the Design window. Infeasible
paths are shown in red, active paths in green, merely feasible paths in amber.
Active paths give rise to creases in the base. They divide the paper up into a
network of <em>polygons</em>, each of which can be filled in with a pattern of
creases known as a <em>molecule</em>. The network of polygons and molecules
gives rise to the full crease pattern.
</p>
<p>
Bases are built in two stages. First, you optimize, which places the nodes
within the square and identifies the active paths of the crease pattern that
form a network of polygons. This explicitly defines the overall structure of
the base and actually implicitly defines the entire crease pattern. Once you
have found a configuration of nodes for which (a) all paths are feasible, (b)
every node in the interior of the paper is pinned, the crease pattern can be
constructed in a second stage.
</p>
<p>
We'll do this second stage now. Go to the Action menu and select
<b>Action->Build Crease Pattern</b>. You will see a bunch of new lines and
polygons appear, as shown in Figure Tu-1-9.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_9.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-9.</b>
</p>
<p>
That's it: we have now computed the full crease pattern, although it's not
completely obvious from the Design window. In fact, you are seeing several
different sets of information overlaid on one another. The tree (shades of
blue) displays the abstract structure of the tree. The yellow polygons display
the underlying structure of the crease pattern. The crease lines display the
creases themselves. In this view, the creases are colored according to their
structural role in the base, rather than by their fold direction. This color
scheme is called AGRH coloring.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Creases that lie along the axis of the base are called <em>axial
    creases</em> and are shown in black. They are usually, but not always,
    mountain folds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Certain creases that lie parallel to the axis of the base are called
    <em>gusset creases</em> and are shown in gray. They are always mountain
    folds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creases that emanate from the corners of molecules are called <em>ridge
    creases</em> and are shown in red. They are always valley folds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creases that run perpendicular to the axis of the base and separate
    distinct flaps are called <em>hinge creases</em> and are shown in dark blue
    (if folded) or light blue (if unfolded).
  </li>
  <li>
    Creases that run perpendicular to the axis of the base that lie within a
    flap are called <em>pseudohinge creases</em> and are shown in cyan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creases that run around the outside of the useful area are called
    <em>border creases</em> and are shown in black. The paper outside the
    useful area is unused; in practice, you would just fold this material out
    of the way.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Because the creases are overlaid on top of everything else, the display gets
rather busy when all of the creases are present. You can choose to display just
the creases by choosing the <b>View->Creases View</b> command, getting the
result shown in Figure Tu-1-10. This turns off the display of everything but
creases, and also uses a different color scheme for the creases, called MVF
coloring.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tutorial_1_10.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Tu-1-10.</b>
</p>
<p>
MVF coloring is closer to the color scheme you might be familiar with from
published origami patterns. In this scheme, creases are colored not according
to their structural role, but according to their fold direction:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Mountain folds are solid black lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Valley folds are magenta dashed lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Flat (unfolded) folds are light gray lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Border creases are also shown in black.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
You might wonder why I don't use dashed and chain lines for valley and mountain
folds, since they are standard origami usage for step-by-step folding
sequences. The reason is that in large complex crease patterns, the traditional
line patterns are difficult to distinguish, and it is more illuminating to use
both color and pattern to distinguish mountain and valley folds.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we have the crease pattern for the base --- the thing we were looking
for all along. There are two ways to get the crease pattern from the screen
onto a piece of paper. First, you can simply print it using the
<b>File->Print</b> command and fold up the printout. You can also choose
<b>View->Plan View</b>, which displays the crease pattern along with the
coordinates of key vertices. You can print this out and use the coordinates to
plot vertices on another sheet of paper to fold it by hand, or use a program
like <em>ReferenceFinder</em> to find folding sequences for the key reference
points.
</p>
<p>
That's all for this example. You have learned the basics of <em>TreeMaker</em>:
how to define a stick figure using the point-and-click interface and how to
construct a basic crease pattern. In the next example, you'll learn how to
modify the stick figure to alter proportions, how to incorporate symmetry, and
how to customize the screen and printed image.
