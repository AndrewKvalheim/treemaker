<h2><a name="tips_1">Tips 1: Adding Nodes</a></h2>
<p>
Once you have defined a tree and found an optimum configuration of nodes, you
have several options for filling in the remaining creases. In this section,
I'll demonstrate several different treatments of the same tree. Construct a
"generic mammal" tree with equal-length head, tail, four legs, and a body 
--- that is, with all edges of unit length --- as shown in Figure
Ti-1-1.
</p>
<p align="center">

  <b>Figure Ti-1-1.</b>
</p>
<p>
Select command <b>Action->Scale Everything</b>; you should arrive at a
distribution of leaf nodes as shown in Figure Ti-1-2.
</p>
<p align="center">

  <b>Figure Ti-1-2.</b>
</p>
<p>
This crease pattern gives a single active polygon, which is a hexagon. Now, as
I said, there are several ways to add creases to this pattern to complete the
base. The simplest is the one we have already learned; simply select
<b>Action->Build Crease Pattern</b>, then <b>View->Creases View</b>. This
selection fills in the active polygon with the "universal molecule" crease
pattern. This is the simplest pattern and produces the least total crease
length of all possible molecules for a given polygon.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_3.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-3.</b>
</p>
<p>
Although the universal molecule is the simplest molecule, it produces a base
with wide flaps; that is, the hinges at each flap are relatively long. In some
cases, the flaps in a universal molecule are actually wider than they are long!
To obtain long, skinny flaps (as in insect legs), the universal molecule
must be repeatedly sunk in and out to narrow its flaps. The folded form of this
molecule can be seen by making the Folded Form window visible (<b>View->Folded
Form</b>).
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_4.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-4.</b>
</p>
<p>
It is possible to narrow flaps by adding new nodes to the tree and inflating
them to break up the active polygon into smaller pieces. For example, in the
tree shown above, kill the crease pattern (<b>Action->Kill Crease Pattern</b>),
then add a node and edge to node 2, as shown in Figure Ti-1-5.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_5.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-5.</b>
</p>
<p>
Observe that this new node has created some infeasible paths (indicated by
their red coloration). That's OK; we'll let <em>TreeMaker</em> find the right
length and position. Select both the new node and its incident edge and choose
<b>Action->Scale Selection</b>. This will expand the new edge to its maximum
possible size, creating new active paths that effectively break up the hexagon
into smaller active polygons --- in this case, two triangles and two
quadrilaterals, as shown in Figure Ti-1-6.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_6.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-6.</b>
</p>
<p>
Building creases gives the crease pattern shown in Figure Ti-1-7, which has the
folded form shown in Figure Ti-1-8.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_7.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-7.</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_8.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-8.</b>
</p>
<p>
This new folded base has all the flaps of the original base, plus one extra
one. The paper for the new flap had to come from somewhere; and since it
couldn't come from the length of the existing flaps, it had to come from their
width. And, as you see, the upper flaps are now not as wide as the lower flaps.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you could have added the new edge to node 5, which would give
you the same crease pattern flopped end-for-end.
</p>
<p>
With either of these two patterns, you get a crease pattern in which the "head"
and "tail" are folded differently. For reasons of symmetry, you might want the
head and tail to be symmetric, in which case, if you add a new edge, you need
to put it in the middle of edge 4. Let's try that now. Go back to Design View,
and delete node 9 (which will also remove edge 8).
</p>
<p>
Select edge 4, and choose <b>Edit->Split->Selected Edge...</b>. This brings up
a small dialog:
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_9.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-9.</b>
</p>
<p>
This command will break the edge into two edges, adding a new node at the
break, from where you can add a new edge. To make the base symmetric, you
should split the edge exactly in half. Since its current length is 1.0, the
split location should be halfway from node 2 to node 5, i.e., 0.5. Enter that
value and click OK. The resulting tree is shown in Figure Ti-1-10.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_10.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-10.</b>
</p>
<p>
Now you can add the new edge. Click on node 9, then click elsewhere to create a
new node and edge, as shown in Figure Ti-1-11.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_11.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-11.</b>
</p>
<p>
Select the new node and edge and choose <b>Action->Scale Selection</b>. After
optimization, the new node will be pinned with four active paths, but will now
be located in the middle of the paper, as shown in Figure Ti-1-12.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_12.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-12.</b>
</p>
<p>
Build creases and convert to Creases View to see the new crease pattern.
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="tips_1_13.png" alt=""><br />
  <b>Figure Ti-1-13.</b>
</p>
<p>
And the folded form is shown here. This time, all four flaps have had their
width reduced to some degree to accommodate the new flap.
</p>
<p align="center">

  <b>Figure Ti-1-14.</b>
</p>
<p>
Suppose after seeing the result, we didn't want to do this after all. You can
remove the node by deleting node 10. But you will still be left with an extra
node in the middle of the model. A node with only two edges connected is called
a "redundant node." You can remove a single redundant node by selecting it and
choosing the command <b>Edit->Absorb->Selected Nodes</b>. This command is only
enabled if you only have redundant nodes in the selection. If you don't want to
track down all redundant nodes, you can choose <b>Edit->Absorb->Redundant
Nodes</b> to remove all redundant nodes from the tree.
