<h2>What is <em>TreeMaker</em>?</h2>
<p>
<em>TreeMaker</em> is a tool for origami design. Simply put: you draw a stick
figure on a square, assigning lengths to each of the sticks in the figure.
Through a series of optimizations and calculations, <em>TreeMaker</em> computes
a crease pattern in the square that folds up into that stick figure. Or more
precisely, it folds into a shape --- called a <em>base</em> --- whose "shadow" is
the given stick figure. In this way, you can use <em>TreeMaker</em> to design
an origami base with flaps of precisely the same size, length, and connectivity
as a desired subject. Along the way, <em>TreeMaker</em> provides many options
for adjusting the crease pattern and/or the stick figure to meet various
artistic and/or aesthetic constraints. For a full description of the program as
well as several tutorials on how to use it, please see the documentation under
the Help menu.
</p>

<h2>What's New</h2>
<p>
<em>TreeMaker 5</em> is a substantial enhancement from its predecessor,
<em>TreeMaker 4.1</em>. Compared to version 4.1, <em>TreeMaker 5</em> adds
the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    It generates a complete mountain/valley assignment for the crease pattern
  </li>
  <li>
    The generated crease patterns are simpler and contain no extraneous vertices
  </li>
  <li>
    There is the ability to see and print the folded form of the computed base
  </li>
  <li>
    The vertex coordinates are more accurate in printouts, allowing you to
    print and "fold on the lines"
  </li>
  <li>
    A completely new user interface makes setting up and editing the structure
    significantly more efficient
  </li>
</ul>
But most importantly:
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>TreeMaker 5</em> is cross-platform, running on Mac, Linux, and
    Windows.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, <em>TreeMaker 5</em> is now open-source; you can download the
source, modify it, port it to other platforms, subject (of course) to the
license restrictions described below.
</p>

<h2>Where's the Documentation?</h2>
<p>
In previous versions, the documentation was a separate file (in fact, in
version 4, because of some squirrelly licensing issues you had to read the docs
to find out how to get the application). In version 5, the documentation is
built into the application, in the Help menu. The Help command brings up a
window containing a full description of the program, its windows and menus, and
several tutorials and tips. Everything in the Help window can be printed (click
on the printer icon) if you want a hard copy of the documentation for reference.
</p>
<p>
While anyone can use <em>TreeMaker</em> to construct a crease pattern for a
base,  using it effectively takes some practice and understanding of the
process of origami design. I would suggest you start by working your way
through the tutorials in the documentation, which will give you a feeling for
the capabilities (and limitations) of <em>TreeMaker</em>. Of course, you can
dive right in and experiment; you'll quickly get a feel for how it works.
